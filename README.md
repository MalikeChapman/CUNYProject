# CUNYProject
Hello, this is just a small project i'm trying to work on that allows the user to upload and download notes and previous tests to/from a database.
Users would need to sign up and add information like classes, professors, majors, etc...

Register as new user with the following info:
Name
Email
GPA
Major
Current Year

then Proceed to profile, profile will have the above info, plus the option to search
search will consist of professors/classes

there will also be an option to upload new papers/docs/notes

all uploads must be classified by type, once the first upload has been made,
a menu option to see all uploads made and a point counter for uploading

all uploads will be linked to both a class, major and professor, should show up in any
provided it matches one of the above three criteria in search

also there will be a main menu once logged in that should have buttons for 
professors
majors
classes

each of which will populate with docs based on classes associated with one of the above

//tbc, general idea of what the app should cover?
